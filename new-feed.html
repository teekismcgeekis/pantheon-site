        So we are making  an adjustment to the way we are handling sign-ups and DKP penalties. 
        We are putting a hold on the decay for now but there will be a -10% DKP penalty if you sign up for a raid and are a 
        no-call/no-show. If you let us know a minimum of 1 hour before the raid (5:30 or 7:30) time that you cannot make the raid, 
        there is no penalty. This applies to both Onyxia and MC. We will be filling spots of the no-call/no-shows 10 minutes before 
        raid time (6:20 or 8:20) with benched players on the sign-up sheet. If you are going to be late, NBD. Just let an officer 
        know and we will hold your spot for you.
